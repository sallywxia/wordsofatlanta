              Four black freshmen from North Carolina A&T sat at the whites-only lunch counter at Woolworth’s in Greensboro, NC. 
              <br></br>This “sit-in” movement quickly took flight and moved across the South…The AUC students had watched the Greensboro events closely. Lonnie C. King, a student at Morehouse college, began to organize a similar demonstration in Atlanta.

              After hearing students’ plan to stage sit-in efforts, the Presidents of the six black colleges in Atlanta initiated a meeting with the student representatives trying to dissuade their efforts. <br></br>Students agreed to adopt a more tactic act to publish their intentions followed by the suggestion of Rufus Clement, the President of Atlanta University, who also raised the $1,500 necessary to publish the appeal in the local papers.

              Nearly two hundred black students staged sit-ins at nine cafeterias and restaurants at City Hall, the State Capitol, the Fulton County courthouse and at the train stations. <br></br> The students were largely middle class; for demonstrations they dressed handsomely, the women in dresses and the men in crisp shirts and sometimes even suits. Atlanta police made seventy-seven arrests that day.

             On the sixth anniversary of Brown vs. Board of Education, more than 3,000 students marched downtown-the largest gathering of black students in Atlanta’s history. <br></br>Their destination was the State Capitol, where, only four years before, defiant Georgia legislators had redesigned the Georgia State flag to place upon it the markings of the Confederate battle flag.

             Black students mounted more protests, and Atlanta discovered its own vulnerability.” Lonnie King Jr. had asked Martin Luther King Jr. to join the sit-in. <br></br>
             On that day, Richard Rich, a chamber stalwart, sat down and wept after Martin Luther king., Jr., was arrested at Rich’s and led away in handcuffs. <br></br> His crime: violating an anti-trepass law by refusing to leave Rich’s when he was denied service at a restaurant inside the store. Fifty-one students were arrested…Most students had agreed to remain in jail rather than post the $500 bail, a tactic they hoped would increase pressure on white merchants, including Martin Luther King, Jr.

             As black protests mounted, Bill Hartsfield attempted to manage the final crisis of his twenty-three years as mayor..Hartsfield called a meeting with sixty black leaders..
             <br></br>After hours of intensive negotiations, Hartsfield agreed to drop the charges and to secure the release of the students from the city jail, and pledged to continue to negotiate with merchants for the desegregation of all downtown lunch counters. 
             <br></br>He also promised to lobby for the release of those held in the county jail. In return, the students gave assurances that their demonstrations would cease for thirty days, which Hartsfield believed, was ample time for him to broker an agreement between the two sides.
